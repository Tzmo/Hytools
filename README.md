# Hytools
A mod that has useful tools for Hypixel. Credit to the modding community for helping me make my first mod + Eye_Of_Wither for using /nick so I can create NickAlert.

**PartyGuess**  
A tool that looks at chat and guesses players that are in a party. PartyGuess also checks if the first player in that party is friends with anyone else in the party. This tool works about **95%** of the time. This could fail if hypixel decides to join everyone at the same time.

**NickAlert**  
A tool that alerts if someone joined is nicked. This tool **will not reveal the person** behind the nick, but will just alert it in chat. This tool will work all the time. (unless if hypixel fixes it)
